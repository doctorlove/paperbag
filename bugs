Why does expanding have a width and a bag width?
(and no tests)

follow up - sometimes goes out of the side

why don't the aco ants ever get stuck if I'm checking possible positions haven't be previously visited?

why do the trails end up bigger than 13*13?

......
What does v start at (pso)?
...try (0,0)

Stop button doesn't work

Should it keep going until all the items have escaped?

Why do the items go up then clamp to the bottom?

Should the "velocity" have an x and y? Why does x not seem to change?
Seems to be moving out of the bag in about 3 steps - the y seems to grow exponetially. Add tests!

Move callouts to canvas, to pass in hieght and width

Item's x moves the first time, but never agterwards
