paperbag
========

Can you program your way out of a paper bag?

I've tried 
1. using something that just gets bigger, in C#, and breaks through the sides, 
2. various little beasties moving around randomly,
3. an ant colony optimisation, to make all the little beasties manage to escape,
4. transforming this to a known problem: escaping a maze, and solving that instead.
   Putting the maze in a paper bag means I have programmed my way out :-)
