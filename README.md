paperbag
========

Can you program your way out of a paper bag?

I've tried 

1. using something that just gets bigger, in C#, and breaks through the sides, 

2. various little beasties moving around randomly,

3. an ant colony optimisation, to make all the little beasties manage to escape,

4. transforming this to a known problem: escaping a maze, and solving that instead:  Putting the maze in a paper bag means I have programmed my way out :-)

5. using genetic algorithms - see http://accu.org/index.php/journals/1821 for details

6. using particle swarm optimiation - currently a work in progress
